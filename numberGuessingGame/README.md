# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This C++ program allows you to play a simple game where you have to guess a random number between 1 and 200 within 7 attempts.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm for generating high-quality random numbers.
- **User Input Handling**: Error handling is implemented to handle invalid user input, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.
- **Clearing Input Buffer**: The program clears the input buffer after each user input to prevent issues caused by leftover characters.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in an interactive gameplay experience with clear prompts and feedback messages.

## How to Play

1. Run the executable file `NumberGuessingGame.exe`.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 200.
3. You have 7 attempts to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
5. If you guess the number correctly within 7 attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start playing the game.
